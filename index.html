    <h1>WHO AM I?</h1>
    <h3 style="color:red"><b><i>Self Intro..</i></b></h3>
    <p>At first,myself i am just a middle class boy who is studying in a engineering a college and leading a normal life which was not that much intersting.
    My college name is <i>B</i>harath Institute of Higher Education and Research.</p><p>it was in chennai and which was buint in the year.<b>Hmm.</b>.exactly i don't know but may be before 30 years i think so.. and coming to me .</p><p>i am a 3rd Btech <i style="color:red;">CSE</i> student.And coming to my campus it was about
    may be 50 Acres or something.....Very big buildings with many trees and having atmost <mark style="color: blue;">6000</mark> Students in the campus.and also having upto 500 faculty members. </p>

    <p>Now the time is about <u>06:36</u> and date is about 17-10-2023.and now i am try to build a normal website of about me.</p>
    <h3 style="color: red;"><i><strong>About Campus Placements...</strong></i></h3>
    <p>Every year many companies are visiting our campus for the talented ones.Among them <mark>Accenture</mark> is one of the Company which aquires large number of students. But as of now ,because of recession there is no jobs for our Seniors.So they are choosing Alternatives like going for higher studies to foreign countries like <u>U.K, U.S.A.etc</u>. we  also don't that we will get jobs or not.but still we are are trying to get knowledge.Because the future of ours became a unbeatable competition like not knowing how much time we will keep running in the race.I always think to become a Hacker but i realised that very lately what to become in my life.So i am now thinking to work on web development.</p>
